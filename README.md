My project for the Front End Class of SHA.
Idea for a React web app to link mobiles with Youtube review videos in order to help people understand the characteristics of the mobiles and get feedback (via likes/dislikes) from other users of the mobiles.
Mostly needed for Xiaomi models that are too many and people get confused of which is which.
